# Plotter

This is a simple program I wrote in 2012 for one of my sons who was sixteen at the time and, after the usual mis-spent youth, was getting hooked on programming and mathematics. He was still struggling with for/while loops much to the amusement of his youngest brother who was already well up the learning curve at that stage. However, once he overcame this hurdle, there was no holding him back. 

Around that time he was doing manual plots (or graphs) of non-trivial functions at school and he saw the immediate benefit of writing a program for said purpose. So you could say that this program killed a lot of birds with one stone. Since he was still at the Turtle Graphics stage, we wanted to keep things as simple as possible -- but no simpler (as Albert Einstein would have said). Indeed, he discovered pretty quickly that producing nice plots ain't as easy as it seems, especially when discontinuities arise. Of course, for that very reason, the educational value of this exercise was immense. And thanks to the Python eval() function, we didn't need to get hung up on parsing equations (notwithstanding the inherent dangers of this approach).

Anyway, to cut a long story short, he took this program and ran with it for about ten nanoseconds, threw it out and started again in his own/inimitable stubborn way which is always a sure sign of a natural programmer. Soon after, he had written a little program for Physics class to simulate reflections and refractions. By the following year, he had won a national computational challenge for secondary school students and has hasn't looked back since.
