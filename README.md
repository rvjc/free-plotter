# Plotter

This is a simple program I wrote in 2012 for one of my sons. He was sixteen at the time and, after a mis-spent youth, was finally pursuing more wholesome and fulfilling outlets. However, the girls were still playing hard to get, so he had to fritter away his weekends on programming and mathematics. Having gotten to grips with functions, he was still struggling with for/while loops much to the amusement of his youngest brother who was already well up the learning curve. Finally, after writing a zillion lines of code in a single program, it hit him like a freight train and there was no holding him back. 

Around that time my son was also doing manual plots (or graphs) of non-trivial functions at school when he saw the immediate benefit of writing a program for said purpose. So you could say that this program killed two birds with one stone. Unfortunately (for me), he hadn't yet weaned himself off Turtle Graphics. But this turned out to be a blessing in disguise as Turtle's slow plotting speed somehow enhanced the experience. Paying homage to Albert Einstein, we had to keep things "as simple as possible, but no simpler" and my son duly discovered that producing nice plots ain't as easy as it seems -- especially when you have to deal with discontinuities and unhelpful screen coordinates. Of course, for those very reasons, the educational value of this exercise was immense. And, thanks to the Python eval() function, we didn't need to get hung up on parsing input equations (notwithstanding the inherent dangers of this approach).

Anyway, to cut a long story short, my son took to this program enthusiastically and ran with it for about ten nanoseconds before throwing it out and starting again in his own inimitable, stubborn way. This is always a sure sign of a natural programmer whose hard edges have not yet been blunted by dot com bubbles, global recessions and flaky operating systems. Indeed, within a few weeks, he felt confident enough to writw a cute little program in Physics class to simulate reflections and refractions. The following year, he won a national computational challenge for secondary school students and it has been all downhill ever since.

This program requires Python 3.x (turtle comes as standard) and runs on any platform. At the time, we tested it on Python 3.2. To make things more interesting, up to three color-coded equations can be plotted on the same graph. The command menu is self-explanatory and some sample built-in plots are provided to get you started.

The last four sample plots are "square" waves based on compositions of Sine waves. This was intended as a sneaky introduction to the Fourier Series which might have led to a better understanding of harmonics for a young music buff. Unfortunately, it totally passed him by because he was totally distracted with for/while loops!
