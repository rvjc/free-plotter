# Plotter

This is a simple program I wrote in 2012 for one of my sons who was sixteen at the time. After a mis-spent youth, he was finally pursuing more wholesome and fulfilling activities. However, the girls were playing hard to get so he frittered away his weekends on programming and mathematics. Having gotten to grips with functions, he was still struggling with for/while loops much to the amusement of his youngest brother who was already well up the learning curve. Finally, after writing a zillion lines of code in a single program, it hit him like a freight train and there was no holding him back. 

Around that time he was also doing manual plots of non-trivial functions at school and saw the immediate benefit of writing a program for said purpose. So you could say that this program killed two birds with one stone. Unfortunately (for me), my son hadn't yet weaned himself off Turtle Graphics. But this turned out to be a blessing in disguise because Turtle's slow plotting speed enhanced the experience. Paying homage to Albert Einstein, we kept things "as simple as possible, but no simpler" and we duly discovered that producing nice plots ain't as easy as it seems, especially when you have to deal with discontinuities and unhelpful screen coordinates. Of course, for those very reasons, the educational value of this exercise was immense. And, thanks to the Python eval() function, we didn't need to get hung up on parsing input equations (notwithstanding the inherent dangers of this approach).

Anyway, to cut a long story short, my son took to this program enthusiastically and ran with it for about ten nanoseconds before throwing it out and starting again in his own inimitable, stubborn way. This is always a sure sign of a natural programmer whose hard edges have not yet been blunted by dot com bubbles, global recessions and flaky operating systems. Within a few weeks, he felt confident enough to write a cute little program for Physics class to simulate reflections and refractions. The following year, he won a national computational challenge and it has been all downhill ever since.

This program requires Python 3.x (Turtle comes as standard) and should run on any platform. At the time, we tested it on Windows with Python 3.2. To make things interesting, up to three color-coded equations can be plotted simultaneously. The command menu is self-explanatory and some sample built-in plots are provided to get you started.

The last four sample plots are "square" waves based on various compositions of Sine waves. This sneaky introduction to the Fourier Series might have led to a better understanding of harmonics for a young music buff. Unfortunately, it passed him by because he had become totally besotted with for/while loops!
