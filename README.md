# Plotter

This is a simple program I wrote in 2012 for one of my sons. He was sixteen at the time and, after the inevitable mis-spent youth, was getting hooked on programming and mathematics. Having gotten to grips with functions, he was still struggling with for/while loops much to the amusement of his youngest brother who was already well up the learning curve. Finally, after a zillion lines of code (in one program!), it hit him like a freight train and there was no holding him back. 

Around that time he was also doing manual plots (or graphs) of non-trivial functions at school when he saw the immediate benefit of writing a program for said purpose. So you could say that this program killed a lot of birds with one stone. Unfortunately, for me, he hadn't yet weaned himself off Turtle Graphics; but, as it turned out, Turtle's slow plotting speed actually enhanced the experience. As Albert Einstein insisted, we had to keep things "as simple as possible but no simpler". Indeed, my son discovered pretty quickly that producing nice plots ain't as easy as it seems, especially when discontinuities arise. Of course, for that very reason, the educational value of this exercise was immense. And thanks to the Python eval() function, we didn't need to get hung up on parsing input equations (notwithstanding the inherent dangers of this approach).

Anyway, to cut a long story short, my son took this program and ran with it for about ten nanoseconds, threw it out and started again in his own inimitable, stubborn way which is always a sure sign of a natural programmer. Within a few weeks, he had written a little program in Physics class to simulate reflections and refractions. By the following year, he had won a national computational challenge for secondary school students and hasn't looked back since.

This program requires Python 3.x (turtle comes as standard) and runs on any platform. At the time, we tested it on Python 3.2. The help is self-explanatory and some sample plots are provided to get you started.

The last four sample plots are "square" waves based on compositions of Sine waves. This was a sneaky introduction to the Fourier Series which might lead to a better understanding of harmonics, etc for a young music buff. However, it didn't get any traction at the time  because he was too damned distracted with programming!
